# PLATO-PIZZA-SQL-PROJECT-

****Maven Plato Pizza Challenge *****

The dataset used for this project was gotten from Maven Analytics Playground, The dataset contains one year (2015) worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.
In this project, I explored the dataset and analysed it using Microsoft SQL  Server and I used Power Query in Excel to include calculated columns  the code used for analysis can be found in this repository.

**Project Steps**
	Power query was used to clean the dataset and create calculated columns.
        Microsoft SQL Server was used to wrangle the dataset and get insight.


**Business Questions**
The purpose of this analysis is to help improve the operations of the restaurant, for this reason, I set out to answer the following questions:
•	The restaurant KPI: total revenue, total orders, average order value, and total quantity of pizza sold.
•	Days and times that are the busiest in the restaurant.
•	Average amount of pizza made per day and per week.
•	Average orders/Pizzas make during the peak period.
•	Days with the best sales/orders.
•	The highest/lowest number of pizzas in an order.
•	What 3 months have the best sales and quantity sold?
•	What are the 3 most and least sold pizza types?
•	What pizza size is the most preferred?
•	What pizza category is the most ordered and what pizzas in each category are the most sold?
•	What pizza generates the most and least revenue?

 **Recommendation**
After analyzing of the dataset, I noticed that majority of the orders were placed between 12:00hr - 13:00hr, which could be as result of lunch breaks, the restaurant is also more productive from 11am – 10pm. I therefore recommend the restaurant change their opening hours on Monday – Friday from 11am – 10pm and also 12noon to 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays.
In order to drive more sales on pizza with low orders I recommend running a promo and advert on those pizza during the busiest orders in the restaurant in order to drive more sales on the pizzas.
